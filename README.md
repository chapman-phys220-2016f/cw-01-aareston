**Author(s):** _Aaron Grisez, Preston Kamada 9/1/2016_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-01-aareston.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-01-aareston)

**Due date:** 2016/09/06

## Specification

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. For Python files that include test functions, GitHub will automatically run your tests with ```nosetests``` on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework in the build status image above.

1. Using ```vim``` in a terminal, create a ```bash``` script named ```mktmpfiles.sh``` that, when executed, creates a new directory ```testfiles``` in the current working directory, then changes the working directory to the newly created directory, then creates 100 empty new files named ```file001.tmp``` through ```file100.tmp```, then changes the working directory back to the original directory. Commit only the file ```mktmpfiles.sh``` to GitHub.
1. Using ```vim``` in a terminal, create a LaTeX file ```testlatex.tex``` (using the template in the ```info``` repository). In this file write an explanation of what the definition of the derivative $f'(x)$ of a function $f(x)$ means.  Include both inline and numbered equations, as well as a proper title, abstract, and section headings. Find a suitable image to illustrate your definition online, and include it as a figure, with proper citation of the source. After ensuring that your LaTeX file compiles properly to pdf, commit only the source file ```testlatex.tex``` to GitHub.
1. Using ```vim``` in  a terminal, create a python file ```testpython.py```. In this file write only a single function ```test_trivial()``` that contains only the line ```assert True```. Commit this python file to GitHub and ensure that the Travis tests detect it and report a passing status. You will need to edit the links in README file and commit the changes to GitHub to see the Travis status image.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

I found learning LaTeX through trial and error to be a bit frustrating, yet rewarding when I started to grasp it. I also found getting thrown back into coding to be an efficient way of relearning the skill.

There was a definite learning curve for the git system which was demoralizing at first. After overcoming that, I feel much more confident. 

_INSTRUCTOR COMMENT:_
_Make sure the "I" is actually a "we" here. It's useful to hear from everyone in the group. Feel free to add constructive suggestions for how to improve the assignment in the future._

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:
